# Overview
The software that I wrote for this project is a mix of simple HTML and JavaScript. The JavaScript contains examples of API calling, as well as modification of the DOM. The project is a simplified version of a card game called 3s. The objective is for the player to get through the entire deck, with ever increasing cards being added to the pile. The pile gets reset by a select few special cards. As of this build, there are no hard coded rules. In addition, multiplayer can be added.  

My purpose for writing this software is to become familiar with JavaScript, and understand it's integration with HTML. I also became familiar with APIs and how to use them. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
